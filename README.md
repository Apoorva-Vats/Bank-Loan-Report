# Bank-Loan-Report
 Bank Loan Report and Dashboard for Enhanced Lending Insights  Background: A leading financial institution seeks to enhance its understanding of lending activities and improve data-driven decision-making by developing a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. 



Problem Statement:
To effectively monitor and evaluate lending operations, the bank requires an integrated reporting and dashboard solution that offers:

A clear overview of loan application trends and funded amounts.
Insights into repayment efficiency and cash flow.
Evaluation of borrower profiles and loan portfolio health.
The absence of a centralized platform for analyzing loan performance, borrower behavior, and repayment patterns hinders the bank's ability to adapt strategies and ensure sustainable growth.

Proposed Solution:
The Bank Loan Report project focuses on creating three interconnected dashboards—Summary, Overview, and Details—each designed to deliver actionable insights into lending operations.

Dashboard 1: Summary
Objective: To monitor overall lending performance and key metrics over time.
Key Metrics:

Total Loan Applications: Total count, Month-to-Date (MTD) applications, and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
Total Funded Amount: Total loans disbursed, MTD figures, and MoM variations.
Total Amount Received: Total repayments received, MTD totals, and MoM trends.
Average Interest Rate: Portfolio-wide averages, MTD interest rates, and MoM changes.
Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Gauging borrowers' financial health, MTD DTI, and MoM fluctuations.
Good Loans vs. Bad Loans:
The Summary Dashboard will differentiate between "Good Loans" (e.g., Fully Paid and Current) and "Bad Loans" (e.g., Charged Off), offering:

Good Loan Application Percentage and Funded Amounts.
Bad Loan Application Percentage and Funded Amounts.
Total repayments received for each category.
A detailed Loan Status Grid View will provide an interactive summary of all loan statuses, enabling users to monitor MTD and MoM metrics, average interest rates, and DTIs.

Dashboard 2: Overview
Objective: To provide a visual analysis of loan trends and metrics across regions, time periods, and borrower profiles.
Charts and Insights:

Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart): Visualizing trends in applications, funded amounts, and repayments over time.
Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map): Highlighting loan metrics by state, showcasing regional lending activity and repayment efficiency.
Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): Segmenting loan metrics by terms (e.g., 36 or 60 months).
Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): Evaluating lending patterns based on borrowers' employment duration.
Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Categorizing metrics by loan purposes (e.g., debt consolidation, credit card refinancing).
Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): Providing a hierarchical view of loan metrics by home ownership status.
These visualizations enable stakeholders to identify trends, assess borrower profiles, and refine lending strategies effectively.

Dashboard 3: Details
Objective: To create a centralized platform for accessing granular loan data, borrower profiles, and performance metrics.
Features:

Consolidated view of loan applications, funded amounts, and repayments.
Borrower-specific insights, including employment length, DTI, and loan purpose.
Filters for detailed analysis by region, loan status, or loan term.
The Details Dashboard ensures users can access vital data efficiently, supporting comprehensive analysis and strategic planning.

Outcome and Strategic Benefits:
By implementing the Bank Loan Report project, the institution aims to:

Enhance visibility into lending operations and portfolio health.
Identify high-performing regions, borrower segments, and loan categories.
Improve cash flow management and repayment strategies.
Develop targeted marketing and lending policies based on data-driven insights.

Insight: Applicants with longer employment tenures may be more likely to repay loans successfully, whereas shorter tenures may present higher risk.
Loan Purpose (Bar Graph): Depicts the most common loan purposes (e.g., education, home, car) to help tailor the bank’s loan offerings.
Insight: Understanding which loan purposes dominate helps focus marketing and product development efforts.
Homeownership (Tree Map): Visualizes the relationship between homeownership status and loan types.
Insight: Homeowners may represent lower-risk borrowers due to asset-backed loans, while renters may be higher risk.
Loan Term (Donut Chart): Displays the distribution of loan terms (e.g., 36 months, 60 months).
Insight: Preference for shorter terms suggests faster repayment cycles, while longer terms may correlate with increased risk.
Regional Loan Distribution (Map): Shows where loans are concentrated geographically, aiding regional managers in identifying trends and opportunities for expansion.
Filters in this dashboard allow users to toggle between total applications, funded amounts, or received amounts, enabling the bank to adjust strategies based on geographic or loan-type insights.

#Key Questions Answered by the Dashboards
What are the most popular loan purposes?
Debt consolidation leads in both volume and funded amount, followed by home improvement and credit card loans.
How do loan grades affect funding and risk?
Lower loan grades (E and F) are associated with higher risk but contribute significantly to funded amounts.
How does employment length affect loan applications and repayments?
Borrowers with longer employment histories (10+ years) tend to repay loans successfully, while those with less than 1 year of employment pose higher risks.
What are the trends in loan terms (36 months vs. 60 months)?
The majority of loans are for 36 months, but there’s significant demand for 60-month loans, indicating a preference for flexibility in repayment.

Key Insights from the Data
Loan Purpose Focus
Insight: Debt consolidation is the most popular loan purpose and should be the focus of marketing efforts.
Risk Management and Loan Grades
Insight: While lower-grade loans bring in more funding, they also come with higher risks. Stricter criteria and higher interest rates can help mitigate these risks.
Employment Length and Loan Repayment
Insight: Longer employment history correlates with higher repayment success, suggesting that employment tenure is a key factor in loan approval.
Loan Term Preferences
Insight: Shorter loan terms (36 months) are preferred, but flexibility with longer terms (60 months) is also valuable.

#Recommendations Based on Insights
Focus on Debt Consolidation Loans
Targeted campaigns emphasizing debt consolidation can drive higher loan applications.
Strengthen Risk Mitigation for Lower Loan Grades
Implement stricter eligibility criteria, higher interest rates, and collateral requirements for higher-risk loans (Grades E and F).
Leverage Employment Length as a Factor in Loan Approvals
Offer more favorable loan terms for applicants with longer employment histories.
Tailor Loan Offerings Based on Term Preferences
Emphasize the benefits of both 36-month and 60-month loan options to cater to different customer preferences.
Geographical Trends in Loan Applications and Repayments Across U.S. States:
Insight:
High Application Volume: States with larger populations tend to see a higher volume of loan applications. For example, California (CA), Texas (TX), and New York (NY) lead in the number of loan applications due to their significant populations and large consumer markets.
Repayment Efficiency in Smaller States: Despite having fewer loan applications, smaller states like South Dakota (SD) exhibit higher repayment efficiency. These states may have smaller but more financially stable populations, resulting in better repayment rates relative to the number of loans funded.
Data Example:
California (CA):
Applications: 6,894
Amount Funded: $78,484,125
Amount Received: $83,901,234
California leads in loan applications and total funding but may experience a lower repayment efficiency when compared to smaller states due to its higher volume of loans and diverse borrower profiles.
South Dakota (SD):
Applications: 63
Amount Funded: $606,150
Amount Received: $656,514
Despite a significantly smaller number of applications, South Dakota shows higher repayment efficiency. The state has a higher repayment amount relative to the funded loans, suggesting that borrowers in this state are more reliable or financially stable.
Conclusion:
Larger States (e.g., CA, TX, NY): High loan applications, but potential for lower repayment efficiency due to a diverse borrower base.
Smaller States (e.g., SD): Higher repayment efficiency despite fewer applications, which may reflect a more financially stable borrower population.
These insights can help target marketing strategies and loan servicing approaches, focusing on improving repayment rates in high-application states and leveraging high repayment efficiency in smaller states for more favorable loan offerings.
